      <h2>Coding</h2>
      <p>I enjoy creating programs and learning new programming languages to build creative projects. I am currently on my last semester of Software Development program and I'm in love with programming. The language I like the most is JAVA! Yes, I know I am crazy but that's the truth. My favorite project that I created was last semester on spring, I made a program that the user could type any year and my program would search for serial killers on Wikipedia related to the year chosen, and the user could type the name of the serial killer so the program would show his picture and the best part: when the picture popped up the classic sound of thriller movies would play. It was very fun!</p>

      <h2>Traveling</h2>
      <p>Exploring new places and experiencing different cultures is one of my greatest passions. And it's not just about the trip, it's about the planning too! My friends always say I am the person that plans the whole trip and they just go, and they are right! Before the trip I take a lot of time researching to find out the best places to go, the best activities, the best restaurants, places to stay, cars to rent. It's not an easy thing to do, but I always make the best itineraries and never miss a good experience wherever I go! On my research I take some time looking up Pinterest posts, TikTok videos, blogs, I even explore the map so I can plan accordingly with the places that are close to each other. If I was rich, I'm sure I would live traveling!</p>

      <h2>Cooking</h2>
      <p>I am Brazilian so I come from a place where we love food and we love reinventing! We have so much creativity cooking that makes it even funnier—we can create some kind of crazy food! I love creating different kinds of pastas, but I also love our traditional Brazilian food so I cook a lot of rice, beans and meat. My favorite Brazilian invention is "escondidinho" which is hard to translate but it's literally "little hidden" in English. It's a layer of mashed potatoes made with mozzarella, a layer of shredded chicken with tomato sauce and seasonings, and another layer of mashed potatoes topped with A LOT of mozzarella and oregano. It's something everyone should try at least once—it's easy to make and it's one of the most delicious foods! Sometimes I only cook because I have to eat, but most of the time cooking is perfect me-time!</p>

      <h2>Watching TV</h2>
      <p>I know you are thinking "this is not an activity" but believe me, for me it is and anyone that knows me can confirm that! I am a completely obsessed person about TV shows and movies. Every time a new season of some show that I already watch is about to come out, I re-watch the whole show all over again just to watch the new season. My favorites are shows, movies or documentaries about true crime—every time I finish watching one I research more about the story. I hate spoilers! I always wait until the end so I can do an extensive research and find everything I'm curious about. I can't even eat without something playing. I am the person everyone asks for recommendations!</p>
